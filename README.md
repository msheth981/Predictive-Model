Predicting First-Hour Job Applicants â€“ Regression Model  

This project applied **machine learning regression techniques** to predict the number of applicants a LinkedIn job post receives within its **first hour** of posting. The goal was to uncover how posting time and day impact early application rates, providing recruiters with actionable insights to optimize posting strategies.  

**Key Highlights:**  
- Collected and logged data on ~95 LinkedIn job postings using filters and custom hourly tracking  
- Prepared dataset in **Excel & RapidMiner**, converting categorical features (day, time blocks) into numeric values  
- Built and tested **Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and Support Vector Regression** models using cross-validation  
- **Linear Regression** achieved the best performance with **RÂ² = 0.869** and **RMSE = 12.829**, while Ridge Regression provided strong generalization  
- Found that **posting time (morning to mid-day)** had the largest impact on first-hour applicants, while the day of the week had minimal influence  

ðŸ”¹ **Outcome:** Recruiters can use this model to **strategically time postings** to increase applicant visibility and engagement.
